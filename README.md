# CS340-Client-Server-Development

1) How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

- It is important to document and write comments in the code explaining functions as this makes it nicer for another engineer to review and edit the code if updates are required. I initially found it difficult to connect MongoDB and making the CRUD Python Module to work, Once the issues were resolved with the database itself, I was able to have both read and write functions run fine. 


2) How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

- Reading requirements are very important to ensure that the right data is presented once complete. Initially, I read over the code template and realized there were a few errors so I corrected them frist. After reviewing the requirements from the client, I wrote all the important aspects down and started working in chunks. Python is a little different with syntax compared to Java or C++ where indentations or spaces dont matter much so this was a challenge. Since this language was relatively new to me, I ended up reading a lot of documentation regarding the Dash framework, Pandas for dataframes, and Python overall for language related syntax. 


3) What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

- Simply stated, Computer Scienctists identify problems and provide solutions. using the strengths of their computer skills. Grazioso Salavare benefits with a dashboard like this to easily view the massive database of animals that they are rescuing. Sifting through a CSV file is doable but very tedious. Having a clear dashboard with multiple functionalities makes it easier to maintain their business
